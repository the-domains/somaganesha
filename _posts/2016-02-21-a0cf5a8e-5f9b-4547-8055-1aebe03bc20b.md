## About me
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/421171eb-f583-439b-a031-816f2b5d753a.JPG)

Writer, photographer, painter, printer, dreamer, intuitive, reiki healer, tarot reader, watcher, student, standup comedian and social media manager for a grassroots consciousness organization. 

Artist.

I have a bachelors degree in Writing and Poetics from a private liberal arts college, and I work three jobs wholly unrelated to my passion. Or are they? 

When I put it in perspective, my entire life, studying so many different things, have led me to cross pollinate my creativity until it bloomed into something that gives me hope and it's hope I want to leave behind, through the power of transrational creativity.
