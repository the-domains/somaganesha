> What are you doing?

> 

My parents have asked me, and they wonder, why don't I settle in for a normal life. I've engaged it, toyed with the idea for most of my life. For a long time, I gave up on my dreams, by pursuing a degree in technical writing and working for **Apple** as a _Genius_ - I used to joke that if I left I would have to get a job at **Microsoft** as a _Guru_ - after which I'd only be able to top it by being a janitor at **Google**. At which point I'd be permanently unemployable.

I used to take a cocktail of **Adderall** and **Xanax** just to function. This is not a joke, though I will use humor to distract you, I'm not a fast paced person, I am the pokey puppy. It's hard to pretend to be normal when you know, deep down, that you're not. I've seen normal, I've seen survival, I've seen the dearth of hope that exists in people who give up on their dreams.

I've seen the turn to distraction happen, an endless parade of lovers, it's not you, it's me, the drugs, the gambling, the drinking, all the self destructive behavior.

I've also seen the positive side, achieving your dreams by getting married, having kids, embracing sports, religion, politics, or creativity.

None of these things made me tick, except creativity, which I used as a distraction by engaging the creativity of others. Often I would get lost in a book, a song, a movie, a tv show, a piece of art, they saved my life multiple times, but I didn't dare think of myself as a creative person, no.

I felt sort of unstuck, oblivious. Like my soul had made a wrong turn in the space-time continuum. I mean where are our flying cars? Hoverboards that actually hover and don't explode? It's 2016 last I checked.

So it was no wonder that when a couple came to me, and only me, at **Apple**, just to chat, and ask questions, that I was oblivious to who they were.

> I call them my Guardian Angels.

I believe that they exist, that they take different shapes and forms, and they work until we recognize them, and when they're caught with their hand in the cookie jar of your soul, they smile and disappear and life changes.

Here's the question they asked me, every time, what are you doing?

My began to life change drastically, I lost an **Aunt** and **Uncle**, I got in trouble at **Apple**, told I was just a number, by a company who brainwashes its employees to **Think Different** - eventually getting fired, for being late too many times, and trying to distract the powers that be from that fact, because I was afraid to lose my job. I found out that they changed their policy soon after I left, and to think I'd still be having to take **Adderall** and **Xanax** daily, shiver me timbers.

I happened to be just entering my Saturn return back then. Something I didn't even know about until recently. Unemployed, I went to Israel, because it was a free trip, and I landed during a war, surrounded by young people, who exist in a society that has settled, given up on its dreams. I remember seeing people crying, while praying at the western wall, where I slipped in pieces of papers with prayers scribbled on them into cracks in the wall. I even put a prayer in for my manager who fired me, because I could see he'd given up on his dreams.

I literally banged my head against the holy wall, the same wall my ancestors prayed at for however long it's been there. I said, I don't get it, I don't get what I'm doing here, show me. You know what I got? Bupkis, in spades. Later that week we were crisscrossing the little country in a bus, and IT happened, a shift, my senses opened wider for the first time, the rolling landscape became part of the music I was listening to, and vice versa, and I was home, not there, in that place, in that land, but in a creativity that was bigger than me. I was crying a lot, people asked me if I was okay, and I was better than okay, I was finally coming to life.

In the years that followed, I traveled, shattered my knee, traveled more, with my best friends, got into a relationship, got out of one, _God Bless_, crossed the **Atlantic** in a boat, crossed the **USA** in a car, raised my nephew for a year, had empty nest syndrome after he left, lived in **Vegas**, in a grow house, with three beautiful and sweet **Pitbulls**, moved to **Boulder**, fell in love with people, fell out of love with people, I meditated, I laughed, I got my degree in creative writing, I performed [standup comedy][0], all along the onion of who I was, rapidly peeling away layers to reveal who I am becoming, a creative person, who settled on their own terms, and is eyeballs deep in debt. I've been sued by **American Express **and had them try to garnish my parents social security money, I'm engaging my shadow, learning to love, and going insane every once in a while.

The reason for me finally doing this **transrational creative work** is not because others did it, though their work sustained me and gave me hope. Not because there has been too much synchronicity to ignore. Not because my father has been training me to be a **storyteller** since I was a kid, by always telling me stories. It is because of the **silent war against consciousness**. I see it, I hear it, I experience it, I am a product of it, but I refuse to be a prisoner or casualty. It is a war that can only be won by creating new realities from a place of love. Life is a gift. This book is a gift of hope to myself. The best part of being human, for me, is getting to hold creation in my embrace, either as a patron, or an artist, and truly, we all are both.

If you can support me in this, by making a contribution to my [crowdfunding][1], any amount helps, sharing this on [social media][2], or buying a [tarot reading][3], it will help me complete work on my first novel. Digital and print copies will be available. Depending on your sponsorship perk, you'll get one or the other or both. Everyone who contributes will get a digital copy of the work so far.

**Robert A. Heinlein** in _Stranger in a Strange Land_ described _nests_ where large families, related and chosen, lived together, learned, played and created, leading to a consciousness revolution. I see the beginnings of this happening now around me.

I'm so grateful for this _big magic_, and I want to support it, be part of it, so I am going to tithe 10% of any money I receive for creative endeavors to a few organizations who are helping people develop consciousness.
