# Love Letter
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/308f33c8-f345-4665-9e88-03b053e56b9d.jpg)

My time with you showed me, 

gentleness is who I am, 

what I am,
inside, 

beyond the fluff, 

intellect, 

ego, 

fear, 

even sexuality, 

it is the love I have, 

the extraordinary gift, 

but the sleeping world doesn't appreciate gentleness, 
so my experience goes, 
the corresponding fear of it being taken advantage of by others, 

internalized, 

scared me so much, 

so often have I turned away from gentleness. 

I have run with abandon, 

all over this sleeping world, 

but I never let the light go out,  

though I fear showing it, 

even to myself, 

how does it, 

or I deserve to exist in this world? 

Yet I do, 

I've carved out a niche of people, 
a tribe,
hard fought and won trust, that bump up against the edges of shadow, 
the apparent barrier between the consuming love I yearn to experience, and the gentleness inside, 

the slow burning sensation as every iteration of my being returns to light,  

my way, 

home. 

Now I can turn to myself and say, 
> 
> I trust you, 
> I believe you, 
> and I accept what you're saying.
