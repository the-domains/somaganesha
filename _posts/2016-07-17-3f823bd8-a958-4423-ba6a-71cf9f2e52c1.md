![“Choosing Love” by David Jacques - a poem intuited while holding sacred space for a group medicine journey. During which I saw Kali sweep my head off and wept for hours, and then, the words came.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f52d1aef-7f20-4424-80a3-869867b86d2a.jpg)

"Choosing Love"

David Jacques

---

The lover asked the beloved, "How many times shall I remind you of my love for you?"

And the beloved replied, "Remind me, remind me, never let me forget your love"

And the lover said, "How can you forget such a thing?"

The beloved replied, "Human memory is an imperfect thing"

And the lover laughed until they fell off their seat

And the beloved scorned, picked up the axe and swept the lover's head clean off their shoulders

The lover's laughter grew louder still as they said, "but the soul is perfect, eternal, and patient"

The beloved dropped to their knees in horror and shock and bellowed, "do not abandon me"

And the lover whispered as every element at once, "never"

I wrote this while sitting for a sacred medicine circle, right after Kali chopped my head off in a vision lol

A poem intuited while holding sacred space for those on a medicine journey. I saw Kali sweep my head of my shoulders and became a conduit for the body to express itself without the mind. Then the words came.
