# Art of Tarot

Along this artist's path I've worked to develop my intuition. It's not been an easy task, learning to trust it, to discern it from ego. In fact, its probably been the most scientific thing I've ever done in my life. Short of, well, sciency science stuff.  Then, at some point, I stopped being so analytical about it. 

For a while I've been using the Osho Zen Tarot deck and sending out readings to people, doing them in person, or just for myself. I truly love and enjoy the ritualistic aspect of it, as well as the access it grants to information just out of reach from the conscious mind. Like my other creative expressions, I strive to act as a channel for the information.

I am offering a weekly Tarot Newsletter, free, just email somaganesha@icloud.com and you'll be on the list. If you like it, and want a personal reading, here are the prices for those:

* $7 for a 1 card quickie
* $14 for a 3 card spread
* $21 for a 5 card reading
* $42 for a 5 card reading and more in depth interpretation & coaching.
