## About Soma Ganesha

A name bestowed upon me during a mystical experience. Something common in my family, though oft spoken of as an afterthought. Some folks take refuge in the name, change their name to match it. For me, it didn't seem like something I should do, but I had to honor it. So I did some research:

## Ganesha: 

Most people are familiar with Ganesha, the elephant headed potbellied God from the Hindu pantheon. Straight from [Wikipedia][0]: 
> 
> Ganesha is widely revered as the remover of obstacles, the patron of arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom. As the god of beginnings, he is honoured at the start of rituals and ceremonies. Ganesha is also invoked as patron of letters and learning during writing sessions.

## Soma: 

My research took me in many directions, soma can mean body, as in somatic. It is also used in science as the cell body of a neuron. Soma is a musician, a water filter, a cannabis grower. 

Soma is the name of a fictional drug in Aldous Huxley's _[Brave New World][1]. _In the novel the drug produces both intoxicating and psychoactive properties and is used in celebratory rituals. It is described as "All of the benefits of Christianity and alcohol without their defects." 

In Neil Gaiman's novel,  _[American Gods][2]: _Soma is referred to as "concentrated prayer", a drink enjoyed by the gods (who feed on people's worship), such as Odin.

[Soma][3] is also a Vedic sacrament taken by one seeking communion with the divine. It is said to produce immortality, to "roar" to be the bringer of the gods. It is a plant, the derivative sacrament drink made from it, and a divinity, forming a triune, akin, in my interpretation, to body-mind-spirit or existence-consciousness-bliss ([Satcitananda][4]). 

Some call it the original entheogen, some have claimed it is the [Amanita muscaria][5] mushroom that was made into the Soma brew. While still others claim it was ephedra, linked to [MDMA][6] and [MDA][7], and finally others claimed it was [_Cannabis indica_][8]. 

Soma's meaning is varied, invented, created, amalgamated.

## Soma Ganesha

Is the remover of obstacles to the embodiment of a transrational, blissful, creative experience.
