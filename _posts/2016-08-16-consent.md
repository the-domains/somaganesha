![A Dirty Rumi Poem](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7b224141-702b-4596-9185-ada249bde327.jpg)

How do you feel about asking for consent?

For everything? 

A game with a serious intention. 

To the point it's embarrassing, but playful, playfully embarrassing, bashful even. 

An exercise in resilience, resilient adoration. 

A way of breaking armor. 

A dance unlike any other. 

Grander than two souls orbiting a black hole called love. 

The ultimate tease and denial. 

Oh, I think it'd be fun, don't you agree? 

Do I have your consent? 

How does it feel when I ask? 

No, this isn't a blatant manipulation. 

It is a seduction of the mind. 

So please don't, don't hide, your heart, not anymore, show me the door, to your soul, unlocked
