# Consent
![A Dirty Rumi Poem](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a7ca7a85f316e1615c0a931eeeb2a71e74c5bb16.jpg)

How do you feel about asking for consent?

For everything?

A game with a serious intention.

To the point it's embarrassing, but playful, playfully embarrassing, bashful even.

An exercise in resilience, resilient adoration.

A way of breaking armor.

A dance unlike any other.

Grander than two souls orbiting a black hole called love.

The ultimate tease and denial.

Oh, I think it'd be fun, don't you agree?

Do I have your consent?

How does it feel when I ask?

No, this isn't a blatant manipulation.

It is a seduction of the mind.

So please don't, don't hide, your heart, not anymore, show me the door, to your soul, unlocked
